## Tips for Effective Cross-functional Collaboration
- **Engage early**: Involve cross-functional roles during initiation and planning, not just execution
- **Define clear expectations**: Document involvement level, deliverables, and timelines upfront
- **Maintain regular touchpoints**: Schedule recurring reviews or checkpoints, not just ad-hoc requests
- **Close the loop**: Share outcomes and learnings with cross-functional partners during retrospectives
