# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README serves as the central entry point for all OctoAcme project management documentation. Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or an experienced contributor looking for a specific process guide, this hub will help you navigate our comprehensive project management framework.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme employs an iterative, customer-first approach to project management that emphasizes clear ownership, psychological safety, and data-informed decision-making. Our framework is built on five core principles: prioritizing customer value, delivering in small testable increments, ensuring clear project ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions, and fostering a culture of feedback and continuous learning.

The project lifecycle begins with **Initiation**, where we validate business needs, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project one-pager that defines the problem, goals, success metrics, and high-level timeline. This gates the project for planning. During **Planning**, we break work into manageable increments, estimate scope, identify dependencies, and set clear milestones with defined acceptance criteria. **Execution & Tracking** follows a team rhythm of daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and regular demos, utilizing project boards and pull request workflows to maintain visibility and quality. Throughout execution, we actively manage **Risk & Communication** through risk registers, stakeholder updates using a single source of truth, and clear escalation paths.

When features are ready, our **Release & Deployment** process ensures standardized releases with pre-deployment checklists, rollback plans, post-deployment verification, and clear communication to all affected stakeholders. After each milestone or release, we conduct **Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement** sessions to capture what went well, identify areas for improvement, and create actionable items with clear owners and due dates. This closed-loop feedback system drives our continuous evolution.

Supporting this entire framework are clearly defined **Roles & Personas** including Developers (who design, build, and test), Product Managers (who define what should be built and measure outcomes), Project Managers (who coordinate delivery, manage schedules and risks), QA/Testing specialists (who validate quality), and Stakeholders (who provide inputs and approvals). Quality assurance is embedded throughout the lifecycle with unit testing, integration testing, automated CI checks, security scanning, and manual QA validation before releases.
